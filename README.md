## Technology
### AI infused chatbot to assist software testers
Via generative AI
- Automatically summarize the current list of testcases
- Automatically identify new testcases that are added between two commits
- Generate test variations and considerations
- Identify which files have changed
- Get information about the latest commit (author, message, date)

### Future 
- Generate test plan of source code for review
- Autodetect test directories in a repository
- Run testcases
- Analyze tests results
- Identify holes in test coverage
- Generate additional tests to increase coverage

## Value
- High quality software is paramount to our company and our clients
- Test domain specific skill takes significant amount of time to grow
- Understanding existing test assets non-trivial coverage in complex software is often intractable
- Open source has become ubiquitous with modern enterprise software development and even foundational open source projects have neglected code quality


## Innovation
- Capturing institutional knowledge without years to decades of test domain experience
- Reduce investigation time to find new tests and changes across commits
- Using commit information recommend the most important areas to test and how to test them
- Validate the description and details of a code change
